    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "\n",
    "I. Gaussian Naive Bayes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In industry, Naive Bayes is often used in sentiment analysis - systematically identifying and extracting opinions from texts, which is useful for evaluating customer feedback for product development. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The Naive Bayes algorithm performs well on classification problems - for example, determining if an email is spam or not spam. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. The algorithm does not perform so well when features are *not* conditionally independent - some features provide information about the probability of another feature (for example that young children are also more likely to be nervous). The “Naive” part of Naive Bayes assumes that the features are independent from each other. So given that an object is a fruit, the color, roundness and diameter of an apple contributes to the probability that the fruit is an apple independently (meaning the color of the fruit provides no information about the likelihood that the fruit will also be red).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The problem we’re trying to solve is a classification problem which plays to the strengths of Naive Bayes algorithm. However, some of the features of the data may be correlated. There may be some relationship between age and education level or age and marital status - so this is a point we need to consider as we proceed. \n",

    "\n",
    "II. Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In computational biology, SVMs are used to classify genes, proteins and cancer. The algorithm has also been effectively used in facial and handwriting recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. SVMs perform well on data that can be classified by a linear classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. SVMS do not perform well in general on nonlinear problems with many features. For large data sets that cannot be classified by a linear classifier, non-linear SVMs must be used which have high computational complexity and are computationally intensive. Choosing the correct kernal can be tricky as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. SVM may be a good candidate for this problem because the data does not have that many features. To address the possibility that the data is not linearly separable we use an RBF kernal. \n",

    "2. GBC is good for imbalanced datasets and can solve a wide variety of problems by optimizing on different loss functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. GBC has many parameters and hyperparameters so can be difficult to tune. Training can take longer and consume substantial computing resources because trees are built sequentially. If the dataset contains highly correlated predictors, GBC also tends to perform poorly.\n",

    "A Gradient Boosting Classifier iteratively improves a weak learner, a model with little correlation to actual data classifications (although it categorizes data better than random guessing). The weak learner is enhanced by minimizing a loss function through gradient descent by using the negative gradient (rate of change of a function in the opposite direction of steepest ascent) to take “steps” toward the minimum of a function. One way to visualize this process is by drawing an analogy to a hiker descending a mountain. Our weak classifier is a decision tree, a model which splits data sequentially until we arrive at a prediction (e.g. spam or not spam).\n",
    "\n",
    "During training, weak learners classify the data, with each iteration increasing focus on the incorrectly classified data by assigning them a greater weight. The algorithm learns by modifying sequential trees through gradient descent - each tree in the series corrects the prediction error of the tree before it. The weak learners are combined until the loss function is minimized. We can think of the ensemble model as each weak learner casting a “vote” on the label for each example, or as a weighted sum of weak learners. After the model is trained we make predictions using the test data.\n",

    "The two features that I chose that were not found in the display were occupation and education level. This could be because occupation may be deceiving because the salary for occupations could vary dramatically, which weakens the predictive power of occupations on income. Education level could also be misleading because there are many college grads who do not make that high of a salary and many people who do not have college degrees who have worked for many years and earn a higher salary.\n",

    "It turns out that the number of years of education is an important factor perhaps because at the high end, it identifies people with professional degrees in law, medicine and business.\n",

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
